PARSEME Shared Task on Verbal MWE Identification - Guidelines repository
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the annotation guidelines repository of the [PARSEME Shared Task on Verbal Multi-Word 
Expressions Identification](https://typo.uni-konstanz.de/parseme/index.php/2-general/202-parseme-shared-task-on-automatic-identification-of-verbal-mwes-edition-1-1).
[PARSEME](http://parseme.eu) was a EU Cost Action on parsing and multiword 
expressions, and is now a community of researchers stemming from this project. More info about the shared task can be found on the project's website.

This is **not the main shared task website**. This repository contains ONLY
materials and information related to the annotation guidelines (but not the 
annotated data itself). Here, you will find:

  * the current version of the annotation guidelines HTML sources in `parseme-st-guidelines`
  * the [issues] concerning annotation doubts, borderline cases, bugs in the tests
  * some scripts to manage the publication of the annotation guidelines in `bin`

Other repositories of the parseme group contain evaluation scripts, annotated data for the organizers,
annotated data for participants, etc.
