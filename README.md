------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the annotation repository of the [PARSEME Shared Task on Verbal Multi-Word 
Expressions Identification](http://typo.uni-konstanz.de/parseme/index.php/2-general/142-parseme-shared-task-on-automatic-detection-of-verbal-mwes).
[PARSEME](http://parseme.eu) is a EU Cost Action on parsing and multiword 
expressions. More info about the shared task can be found on the project's 
website.

This is **not the main shared task website**. This repository contains ONLY
materials and information related to the annotation of the data (but not the 
annotated data itself). Here, you will find:

  * the current version of the annotation guidelines HTML sources
  * the issues concerning annotation doubts, borderline cases, bugs in the tests
  * some scripts to manage the publication of the annotation guidelines

Other repositories contain evaluation scripts, annotated data for the organizers,
annotated data for participants, etc.
